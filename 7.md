# Challenge: Submit a Pull Request

Now let's add our part to the story! We can also open up a file from Bash.

Type

    open collaborative-story.txt

It should open up the file in your computer's text editor. Add your own portion of the story after the last sentence.

When you're done, save the file. Make sure you keep it saved as a .txt file. 

### Push Changes
Now let's add our changes to our forked copy and then submit them to be added to the DIY original file. 

Return to Bash and let's check what changes we've made. Type:

    git status
 
![git status](http://diy-visualpedia.s3.amazonaws.com/git-status.png)

This shows you what files you've made changes to - it should say `collaborative-story.txt`. Let's see the *difference* before and after our changes with **diff**. 

    git diff
  
![git diff](http://diy-visualpedia.s3.amazonaws.com/git-diff.png)

You'll see a plus and minus sign showing the before and after. Press `Q` to exit the diff. 

###Add Changes
Let's tell Git what files we want to add, what our message about our changes is, and push those changes to our fork.

![git status add commit push](http://diy-visualpedia.s3.amazonaws.com/git-status-add-commit-push.png)

Start by adding your changed file:

    git add collaborative-story.txt
    
**Pro tip** if you have multiple files and want to add them all, you'll type `git add .` The period means *all*.

### Commit Changes
Now we'll add a *message* describing our changes and attach that to our push.

    git commit -m "your description of changes"

### Push Changes to our Fork
Now, finally, we'll actually push the file and message to our fork on GitHub. Remember our fork's name is *origin* (it's our original file) and the branch is *master*.

    git push origin master    

### Pull Request
Now our computer (local) files and our fork (remote) on GitHub match. Let's submit our changes to DIY to be added to the original. We're **requesting** they **pull** our changes into their files.

You do this part online. If you go to your forked repo on GitHub's website, you'll see a button near the top right `Pull Request`, click this.

![click pull request](http://diy-visualpedia.s3.amazonaws.com/click-pull-request.png)

You'll be taken to a page that shows DIY's original on the left and your fork on the right. Fill out the form to describe to DIY what it is you're suggesting they add and then click `Send pull request`.

Now DIY staff will get an alert of your request, be able to see your changes and merge them into the original. When the next user forks or pulls and update of this repo, they'll get your updates too!

![pull request](http://diy-visualpedia.s3.amazonaws.com/pull-request.png)

WOW! You've just forked, cloned, pulled, pushed and pull requested like an open source programming pro!

This walk through was long, but we did a lot of setting up. Now, if you wake up one day with some story inspiration, all you need to do is use Bash to navigate back to your folder and pull any updates that have been made since you last checked the files:

    git pull upstream master

Then open up the text file and make changes. Save your changes and then:

    git push origin master
    
Next, go to your GitHub page for the repo and select Pull Request. You've done it again!

We've got a couple other files on this repo that need your imput, too. Check them out!
