# Git and GitHub

**Git** is software that helps manage your code. It allows you see the changes that you've made, called *diffs*, and undo changes when you've saved mistakes! **GitHub** makes Git even easier and social. With GitHub you can put your code online and share it with others. Users can create new projects and work together on projects -- making something better, together. Like the Petigraffe above!

Lots of places use GitHub for their code and a lot of places open source their code. Here is [DIY's account](https://github.com/diy) - all of our code that runs the website and app is stored on GitHub and we've made 30+ projects open source. And did you know, [Mojang](https://github.com/Mojang) who make Minecraft are on GitHub, too. 

Oh, and GitHub has a cool mascot, Octocat, check out all the [personalities](http://octodex.GitHub.com/)!
