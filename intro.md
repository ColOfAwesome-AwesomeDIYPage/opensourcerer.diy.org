# Introduction

## DIY's First Guide

We created this guide to walk you step by step through using Git and Github - really useful tools in open source. At the same time, it is walking you through completing all of the challenges for the [Open Sourcerer Skill](http://www.diy.org/skills/open-sourcerer)!

## What is Open Source?

Open Source is a phrase used to describe sharing how you made something. When you show someone on DIY how you made your project, you're open sourcing that project! 

The phrase is most commonly used to refer to code and programing. The code that makes up a project is its **source code** and when you open that source code up to everyone, showing them how the project was made, the code becomes **open source** - which is great because everyone can work together and learn from each other!
