#Challenge: Pull in Bash

### Connect to Original and Pull Changes
We have one last thing to do. Because this is an open project, we can expect that may others will be doing the same as us: forking, cloning and making changes to the files. We want to make sure we're always working with the most up to date files. To ensure this, we'll connect our local copy to the DIY original so that we can **pull** in the most recent changes before we work on ours. If you go back to the DIY page for [Open-Sourcerer](http://www.github.com/diy/open-sourcerer), just like our fork had an address, this repo has an address too. You'll see the HTTP address near the top middle. We're going to name this connection *upstream* (because this is where updates will come from).

Type

    git remote add upstream https://github.com/diy/open-sourcerer.git 

### Pull Changes
Before we make any additions, we want to make sure we have the latest files by pulling in any changes from the *master* branch *upstream*.

Type

    git pull upstream master

If it says 'Already up to date' then no changes have been made since you started setting up! If there were changes, it updated your files. In both cases, your files will match the files on DIY's GitHub.com repo.
