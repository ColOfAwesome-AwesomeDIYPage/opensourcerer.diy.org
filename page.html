            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Authoring a Skill for DIY.org is fun, difficult, and most of all, rewarding. As soon as you see a Maker complete one of the Challenges you’ve made, you’ll feel a warm, fuzzy feeling – like a proud parent. But it’s tricky to get a Skill to be just right. That’s why we’ve compiled this guide for new Skillmakers.</p>
